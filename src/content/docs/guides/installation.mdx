    This is the easiest way to install CounterStrikeSharp. It will automatically download the latest release and install it for you.

    Run the following script from the root directory (that contains the `game/` folder) of your server to install CounterStrikeSharp.

    <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
      ```shell
      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp/main/eng/install/install.sh)"
      ```

    This method requires you to download the latest release and manually copy the files to your server.

    `CounterStrikeSharp` uses `Metamod:Source` as its main way of communicating with the game server, so both frameworks will need to be installed.

    If you're more of a visual person, here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlsKzStHJuY" target="_blank">Youtube video</a> that covers everything.

    ### Prerequisites
    - <a href="https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php/?branch=master" target="_blank">Metamod: Source 2.X Dev Build</a>
    - <a href="https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp/releases" target="_blank">CounterStrikeSharp With Runtime</a>

    ### Installing Metamod

    1. Extract Metamod and copy the `/addons/` directory to `/game/csgo/`.
    2. Inside `/game/csgo/`, locate `gameinfo.gi`.
    3. Create a new line underneath `Game_LowViolence    csgo_lv` and add `Game    csgo/addons/metamod`.
    4. Restart your game server.

    Your `gameinfo.gi` should look like <a href={example.src} target="_blank">this</a>. Type `meta list` in your server console to see if Metamod is loaded.

    ### Installing CounterStrikeSharp

    1. Extract CounterStrikeSharp and copy the `/addons/` directory to `/game/csgo/`.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Restart the server and run `meta list` in the console to see if CounterStrikeSharp is loaded successfully:

```shell
meta list

:::caution
For Windows servers, you must have <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe" target="_blank">Visual Studio Redistributables</a> installed otherwise CounterStrikeSharp will not work.

### Upgrading CounterStrikeSharp

To upgrade CounterStrikeSharp you can simply re-run the [installation script](#script-installation) or manually download the latest release and copy it to your server.

CounterStrikeSharp is designed in a way where your configuration files will not be overwritten if you do this. As CounterStrikeSharp is already installed, you may download the non `with-runtime` build, but you will need to ensure your .NET runtime is up-to-date yourself. 

### Troubleshooting

- If this is your first time installing, you **MUST** download the `with-runtime` version. This includes a copy of the .NET runtime, which is required to run the plugin.
- Depending on your OS you might also either need to install `libicu` / `icu-libs` / `libicu-dev` using your package manager for .NET to run.
- If you get `Unknown Command` when typing `meta list` into your console, double-check the folders are copied over correctly and that your `gameinfo.gi` file is correctly modified.

Your folder structure should look like this:

```shell
<server_path>/game/csgo/addons > tree -L 2
